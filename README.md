# AI Did It Myself

**What if a developer relied on AI for everything?**

_AI Did It Myself_ is a satirical project with semi-satirical results. It simulates a developer who over(relies) upon AI to solve every conceivable problem and question (while also claiming all the results as their own work).

This app is an experiment in the the strengths and limitations of applying AI with real-world problems. Originally conceived as a project that would constitute 100% on AI-generated code, it became evident early on that a significant amount of adjusting, fine-tuning, and workarounds were necessary. To the point where in some instances I had to intervene directly in order to actually _save_ time and effort.

Also, it was just amusing to do.

## How It Works

1. Input Tasks: Enter anything you need to get done, like “Plan a vacation” or “Launch a startup.”
2. Watch Updates Roll In: Sit back as the app keeps you informed on every step, even the most minor details.
3. Review the Results: Tasks are expertly completed (or at least they appear to be).

## Example Workflow

- Task added: “Design a logo.”
- Update: “AI is brainstorming creative ideas and refining the concept.”
- Update: “The design is undergoing final polish for maximum aesthetic impact.”
- Final Message: “Task complete! Deliverables available upon request (or soon).”
